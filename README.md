Machine learning techniques are widely used in the prediction and diagnosis of different types of cancers in the medical field. This project deals with the prediction of breast cancer with different machine learning techniques namely LogisticRegression, DecisionTree , RandomForest.The accuracy of these algorithms has been evaluated with hyper parameter tuning. GridSearchCV and KFold Cross Validation have been used to tune the hyperparameters. The accuracies obtained with these different techniques have been compared.

The accuracies obtained by the above algorithms are as follows:

Logistic Regression — 98.24%
Decision Tree Algorithm — 92.98%
Random Forest Classification — 97.36%
The breast cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset has been used to predict and diagnosis Malignant(M) from Benign(B) tumours. The above data has been taken from Kaggle and University of California Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository.
